## Detailed Description

So, here we were asked to crate a Clone of the webSite Fastrack.com
Here we have used react for the front end and node express as the backend and mongo db as the database
We have added features like Login/Signup and Cart Payment Gateway and we tried to make it exactly lookalike.
I am good with react and front end so i tried to help everyone with the desiging and copying it from front end 
Here we have used heruko for depolyment of the backend.
